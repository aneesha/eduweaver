It is a tool that can be useful when used appropriately, but it is not a substitute for good study habits and critical thinking skills. As educators, it is important to help students understand both the potential benefits and drawbacks of using technology like ChatGPT and encourage them to use it responsibly.

As learning designers, we can create online modules that incorporate ChatGPT in a way that emphasizes its strengths and helps students avoid its weaknesses. For example, we can design learning activities that encourage students to engage with the tool in a way that promotes critical thinking and problem-solving. We can also provide resources that help students understand how to avoid plagiarism and use ChatGPT as a tool to improve their writing skills.

Overall, the key to successfully integrating ChatGPT into student learning is to approach it with a critical eye and a focus on helping students develop the skills they need to succeed in their studies and beyond.
