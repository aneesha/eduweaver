EduWeaver uses ChatGPT API to make a LiaScript course (more formats coming soon). EduWeaver can be considered an AutoCourse maker. EduWeaver uses LangChain.

EduWeaver runs as a Google Colab Notebook. Click here -> [![Open In Colab]([link to image on GH](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg))](link to your URL) to open in Google Colab.
